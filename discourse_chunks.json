    "text": "Hi manmeet, I don’t know about solution to this. Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.",

Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit",

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly. @carlton, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward",

    "text": "Good evening @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @s.anand Sir, I hope you are well According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V.",

This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.",

In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file. The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.  The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible. Thank you for your support.",

The keys to a successful Project 1 are: Deliverables, and an example of the Evaluation has been provided. If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered. Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764×1764 374 KB Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom. So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test. Kind regards",

This project was a team effort by me and two friends [ @lakshaygarg654 and @23f2004637 ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate our project to TA and Anand Sir in a Google Meet session on March 31st (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th). If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.",

    "text": "Thank you for your response @carlton and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience. The reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next. We will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100. Meanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated. Looking forward to",

The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:  The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time",

The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced  Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.  Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete",

Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern.

From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project",

If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand:   We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because",

    "text": "in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.   Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.

And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared",

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work,",

Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.  What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning.   Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?” Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?”  Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds.  Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…",

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be",

How this is beneficial?  As the GATE exam has now been completed,  we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term  Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS. Looking forward to your guidance and kind consideration Regards Aryan",

These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers.",

    "text": "The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”  So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind",

There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome. The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information. I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different. Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed.",

(On 15th Feb 1:26AM) Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards",

Here are the highlights of the discussion:  We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.  All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the",

    "text": "@carlton @Jivraj @s.anand We truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -   Why is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student. (Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.   Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.   Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.   Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi Vikram, This is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):  You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py",

This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense.

    "text": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular?     If thats",

    "text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different",

    "text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:   Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.   Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.   Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.     Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)  • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.  Using requirements.txt  • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r",

Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

In such a case, how to drop the course Tools In Data Science(already registered) and get it replaced with another course to save time and without incurring financial losses(as dropping a course refunds only a certain percentage of fees amount paid for the course), and do it again later in terms. It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.",

The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?",

    "text": "I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses. Additionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials. I would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this. PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

    "text": "Dear all, I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator.  This is the basic prototype. This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators. A heartfelt thanks to @s.anand, our course instructor, and TAs @Carlton and @Jivraj, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible. I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:  Expand functionality and evaluation models. Fix bugs and optimize workflows. Improve documentation for broader accessibility.  The GitHub repository is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all! Update: here is a video explaining the process - https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared Best regards, Avinash Shrivastava",
